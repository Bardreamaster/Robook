## 简介

**The Bionic Design + Learning Lab** is led by **Dr. Song Chaoyang** at the Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech) with research interests in Bionic Design, Robot Learning, and Design Science. Dr. Song completed his undergraduate degree at Tongji University, Shanghai, China, in 2009 and his Ph.D. degree at the Robotics Research Center at Nanyang Technological University, Singapore, in 2014. His doctoral research focuses on the theoretical kinematics of a class of overconstrained linkages, dealing with the fundamental mechanism theory in robotics and mechanical engineering. Dr. Song joined the newly founded Singapore University of Technology and Design during post-doc research. His post-doc research moves towards the application end of research and development, investigating the factor of technological and design innovation in the successful translation of lab results into commercial products. He continued his post-doc research topic at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Before joining SUSTech, Dr. Song was appointed as a Lecturer (Assistant Professor) in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at Monash University, where the **Sustainable + Intelligent Robotics Group** was originally formed. We updated the lab name as the newly formed **SUSTech Institute of Robotics** shares the same acronym.
